# tern-angularjs

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/angelozerr/tern-angularjs.png)](http://travis-ci.org/angelozerr/tern-angularjs)

This project is a fork of the tern angular of tern which is used inside https://github.com/angelozerr/angularjs-eclipse

It contains several tests.

My goal is to contribute with little PR to the original angular tern plugin.
